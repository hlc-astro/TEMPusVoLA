## TEMPusVoLA
The Timed Epstein Multi-pressure Vessel at Low Accelerations (TEMPusVoLA) is an experimental facility that I concieved and developed, with cooperation between the Swiss Unstitutes: University of Bern, ETH Zurich, University of Zurich Skylab foundation, and the European Space Agency (ESA). The experiments involved two-phase flow (with low-pressure gas and cosmic-dust analogue particles) that were levitated in microgravity conditions in parabolic flight campaigns (PFCs). The apparatus was first flown on the 4th Swiss PFC, and subsequently on the 75th and 78th ESA PFCs. The project was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, National Center for Competence in Research (NCCR) PlanetS.  

The publication that outlines the scientific goals, explains the technical design, and demonstrates the technical realization of the project can be found in an article in the [Review of Scientific Instruments](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article/93/10/104502/2845048/TEMPus-VoLA-The-timed-Epstein-multi-pressure). Data associated with this publication can be obtained [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7556637). This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that were used for calculations of the experimental parameters.
