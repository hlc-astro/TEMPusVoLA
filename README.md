The Timed Epstein Multi-pressure Vessel at Low Accelerations (TEMPusVoLA) is an experimental facility that I concieved and developed, with cooperation between the Swiss Unstitutes: University of Bern, ETH Zurich, University of Zurich Skylab foundation, and the European Space agency. The experiments involved two-phase flow (with low-pressure gas and cosmic-dust analogue particles) that were levitated in microgravity conditions aboard parabolic flights.
